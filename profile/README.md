## Welcome to Exness GitHub 

Exness is a multi-asset broker with an international team of approximately 2000 people, a third of whom work in the Technology, Data and Security offices. Our goal in Exness is to develop exceptional products that will help experienced traders to trade various assets with better-than-market conditions.

Since our founding in 2008, we work with the firm belief that trading can - and should - be ethical. We developed proprietary algorithms and services to give our clients the most effective trading tools and conditions in the industry. Ambitious business goals balanced by genuine care for our customers and a healthy level of technical perfectionism define our model. And thanks to this approach, in 2022, our monthly trading volume reached $2.7 trillion, and the number of active users exceeded 320,000 people worldwide.

Our chosen path encourages employees to deepen their technical expertise, rely on scientific methods, and seek innovative solutions. We work on a modern stack without having to deal with excess legacy, and our architecture stands on k8s, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, REST or gRPC as an alternative. We use the GitOps through Gitlab CI approach and cover everything with automated integration testing. Some of our teams' favorites are ClickHouse, MongoDB, React, and Flink.

Our clusters are automatically managed through the code and can handle thousands of events per second. We use Kafka to decentralize our service, and the main languages our tech team uses are Python and Go while in the Trading Core, we also use C++ and C#.

For the front-end, we use React, and most of the projects are TypeScript SPAs using technologies such as Web-sockets, Service Worker, PWA, Web-push, AB-testing, and Webpack Federation.
